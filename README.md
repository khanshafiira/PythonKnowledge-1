## About Python Variables
A variable is a placeholder for data that Python can remember later in the coding process when an action is needed. Technically speaking, the variable serves as an address for where the data is kept in memory. A Python variable can be allocated a value of one type, then reassigned a value of another type.

To make a value in a variable, the `=` operator can be used between the variable name and the value to be stored.
For Example:
- `x = "blueberry"`
- `x = 5`
